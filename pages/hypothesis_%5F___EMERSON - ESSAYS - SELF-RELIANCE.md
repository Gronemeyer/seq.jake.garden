- 📌 To believe our own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private
  heart is true for all men, -- that is genius. Speak your latent conviction,
  and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes
  the outmost, --and our first thought, is rendered back to
  us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. #[[quotes]] #[[motivation]]
- 📌 A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. #[[annotation]] #[[motivation]]
	- 📝 He is saying to follow your inner voice, your inner star, and to speak as a soul inhabiting an individual body - that should be one's focus rather than seeking truth from the sphere of truth-speakers (ie. sages and bards)
- 📌 We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each
  of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. #[[motivation]]
- 📌 piquancy #[[definition]]
	- 📝 ;a pleasantly sharp and appetizing flavor.
	  ;the quality of being pleasantly stimulating or exciting.
- 📌 The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. #[[annotation]]
	- 📝 The healthy attitude to is to rest assured in the unfolding of potential, with a sort of nonchalance and naive attitude paired with the confidence of one who does nothing to placate, or conciliate, the feelings of others in the way
- 📌 Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better
  securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and
  culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity.
  Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators,
  but names and customs. #[[society]] #[[culture]]
- 📌 Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.
  Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.
- 📌 A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. #[[manhood]] #[[quote]]
- 📌 Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,--as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish
  to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his
  actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony #[[virtue]] #[[manhood]] #[[individuality]]
- 📌 The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers,--under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are. And,
  of course, so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself.
- 📌 asinine #[[definition]]
	- 📝 extremely stupid or foolish.
- 📌 Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.--'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.'--Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.
- 📌 I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;--read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing, contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.
- 📌 squalid contentment #[[definition]]
	- 📝 ; showing or involving a contemptible lack of moral standards. -- in a state of satisfaction
- 📌 What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? #[[quote]] #[[inspiration]]
- 📌 We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. #[[inspiration]]
- 📌 prate #[[definition]]
	- 📝 talk foolishly, tediously about
- 📌 rove #[[definition]]
	- 📝 wander
- 📌 Power is in nature the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore
  self-relying soul. #[[selfhood]] #[[nature]]
	- 📝 the self-reliance of the soul as evidenced in nature.
- 📌 to put itself in communication with the internal ocean #[[quote]]
- 📌 All men have my blood, and I have all men's. Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say,--'Come out unto us.' But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act. "What we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love." #[[solitude]] #[[selfhood]]
- 📌 Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the government, he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.
- 📌 Insist on yourself; never imitate. #[[quote]]
- 📌 Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them. #society
