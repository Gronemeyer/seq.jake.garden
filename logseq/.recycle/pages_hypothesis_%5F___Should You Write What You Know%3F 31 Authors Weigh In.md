hypothesis-title:: Should You Write What You Know? 31 Authors Weigh In
hypothesis-naming-scheme:: 0.2.0

- Highlight: " A human self is made up of stories. These stories are rooted partly in experience, and partly in fantasy. The power of fiction lies in its capacity to gaze upon this odd circumstance of our existence, to allow us to play with the conundrum that we are making ourselves up as we go along.Our bodies are complex biological machines. As long as they live, they create a story about themselves in order to function. We call this story the self. We believe in the reality of the story. We believe the story controls the machine. Yet we are constantly reminded that things are not so simple. We do things not in keeping with our stories, sometimes horrible things. And when we do, we say, “I wasn’t myself.”Writing is a chance for the stories that are us to come to terms with their innate fiction. So write what you know. But also know you are being written.” " #[[quote]] #[[writing]] #[[advice]] #[[selfhood]]

- Highlight: " I think what’s behind “write what you know” is emotion. Like, have you known happiness? Have you ever been truly sad? Have you ever longed for something? And that’s the point, if you’ve longed for an Atari 2600, as I did when I was twelve, all I wanted was that game console, if you have felt that deep longing, that can also be a deep longing for a lost love or for liberation of your country, or to reach Mars. That’s the idea: if you’ve known longing, then you can write longing. And that’s the knowing behind “write what you know.”” " #[[quote]] #[[writing]] #[[advice]]

  📝 > “Don’t Write What You Know,”  by Bret Anthony Johnston
- Highlight: " You should write something that you need to go and learn about. Make the writing process a learning process for you. In Inferno, I learned so much about genetic engineering, so much about Dante, that I didn’t know. And my learning, through the process of the novel, through research and talking to specialists, was really what kept me motivated. So for a young author who says “I don’t know what to write about,” I’d say, what have you always wanted to know about? Go learn about it—if you want to know about it, probably someone else wants to know about it, and let your learning process be the catalyst for you to take other people on your learning process, through your novel.” " #[[quote]] #[[writing]]

- Highlight: " The terrible fact is that if you know something, the chances are I know it, too. The idea, ideally, is to be open to the possibility that in the course of writing the poem, one will discover something, will learn something, something one did not know.Do you think it’s possible to learn something in the middle of a poem?Absolutely. If that’s not possible then there’s no point in doing it.” " #[[quote]] #[[writing]]

- Highlight: " “You absolutely should write about what you know. There are all sorts of small things that you should store up and use, nothing is lost to a writer. You have to learn to stand outside of yourself. All experience, whether it is painful or whether it is happy is somehow stored up and sooner or later it’s used.” " #[[quote]] #[[writing]]

- Highlight: " I was told to write poems that cost me something to write them. They cost me a lot. Too much? I’m still carrying ones and zeros on the budget. I go to poems looking for heart. You can tell when a poet has put a lot of heart into the poem and you can tell when they left it out. Some of them favor brain. But for me, all brain is no ache but headache.” " #[[quote]] #[[writing]] #[[poetry]]

- Highlight: " I’d rather challenge people to figure out a way to get their work to connect with what really means something to them, however they’re going to do it. It doesn’t always mean writing about what you know, but it means writing about something in a way that’s going to get you to use your best and most troubling material. " #[[quote]] #[[writing]]
